--This project, I installed spotify data from Kaggle, created a table to put the spotify data into, and used SQL for data analytics

"CREATE TABLE" HELP 

--I first queried which tracks were the loudest and from which artists.
SELECT Spot.artist_name, Spot.track_name, Spot.loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata Spot
ORDER BY loudness desc;

--Then I determined the average popularity and danceability between all tracks.
SELECT AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity, AVG (danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Finally, I rounded up and found what tracks were above average in the tracks in popularity and danceability.
SELECT track_name, popularity AS above_avg_popularity, danceability AS above_avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 86.75
AND danceability > 0.6804
ORDER BY AVGpopularity desc;
